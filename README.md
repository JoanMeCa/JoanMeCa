### Welcome, I've been waiting for you...
I'm Joan Menéndez Calafell, but you knew that already didn't you?
Well then, allow me to introduce myself nonetheless...

☠️ Myself ☠️

Before going into my life and such, you should know a thing or two about me...

    --- GENERAL INFORMATION ---

🛠️ My Career 🛠️

As a 19 year old, I've worked at the astonishing number of 0 places.

...

As I said, I'm 19, I'm busy enough studying.

🎓 My Studies 🎓

Encountering myself at the end of my student life, I've had a more or less straight path:

    --- STUDIES ---

    * Primary Education --- CEIP Son Pisa
    * ESO --- IES Ramon Llull
    * FP SMR --- Sant Josep Obrer
    * FP AMD --- CIDE

🌈 My Future 🌈

Dark, more dark than the void of outer space...

Okay, maybe not so black.

    --- WHAT AM I DOING? ---
    A very good question, right now, as I'm finishing my studies, I'm looking to start working almost immediately after
    finishing my studies, and, after that, don't really know...

    I've thought about going through other studies, but still, it's a future a little too far away for me to plan 
    something right now, so, for the time being, I'm happy with getting a job after the studies 
    (and the money, the oh so useful money).
    
And that's about it, if you wish to contact me, you can always send an email or go through the links on my profile.

See ya!
